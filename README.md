Sample Ansible playbooks
============================================

Here are a few sample playbooks.  These assume that you already have an
Ansible setup going.  You can then drop the files of the example
directly into your setup.

* [mailserver/](mailserver/) sets up a mail server with Dovecot, Postfix
   and the SSL certificates you provide yourself.
* [jenkins/](jenkins/) sets up a Jenkins server with a number of plugins.
