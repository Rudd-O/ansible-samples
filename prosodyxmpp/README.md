# Complete XMPP server with updated support for modern XEPs â€” ideal for Conversations

This Ansible playbook deploys a full Prosody XMPP server on your Fedora 25
(or higher) server.  It also deploys a number of modules to make the operation
of the server most compatible with [excellent features of modern chat clients
such as Conversations](https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/blob/master/README.md#xmpp-features).

See the file `vars/xmpp.yml` for more information on how to configure the playbook.
You may have to configure your Ansible's `hash_behavior` to `merge` dictionaries.

## Prerequisites

### Firewall notes

You will need to open TCP ports:

* 5000
* 5222
* 5269
* 5281

### SSL notes

See the instructions for the mailserver recipe to understand how to configure the
SSL certificates for your XMPP server.  The SSL certificate must be for the
"virtual domain" of your server, not for the hostname or IP address of the actual
machine running the service.

See https://prosody.im/doc/certificates for more information.

### DNS notes

You will need to add DNS records for your client to find the server.

Assuming your server (and the SSL certificate) are `example.com`, here is a
good example of how the DNS records in the `example.com` zone file would look like:

```
$ttl	38400
@	IN	SOA	ns1.example.com. example.example.com. (
			2017020603
			1800
			1800
			604800
			1800 )

			IN	NS  ns1.example.com.
			IN	NS  ns1.backupdns.com.
			
			IN	A   1.2.3.4

.
.
.

xmpp                    IN  A       1.2.3.4
_xmpp-client._tcp 18000 IN SRV 0 5 5222 xmpp.example.com.
_xmpp-server._tcp 18000 IN SRV 0 5 5269 xmpp.example.com.
_xmpps-client._tcp 18000 IN SRV 0 5 5222 xmpp.example.com.
_xmpps-server._tcp 18000 IN SRV 0 5 5269 xmpp.example.com.
.
.
.
```

See https://prosody.im/doc/dns for more information on the matter.

## Usage

Once you have met the prerequisites, configured the variables in `vars/xmpp.yml` as per your desire, and you have set up the playbook `role-prosodyxmpp.yml` to run against your intended Fedora server, simply run the playbook against it.

Here is a command line example you can run when the working directory containing the playbook is active:

```
ansible-playbook -v role-prosodyxmpp.yml
```
