  # autoregister_incoming_mail will cause incoming mail to be registered in
  # the spam / ham wordlists automatically, based on whether bogofilter
  # classified it as spam or ham.  This maps to the -u option of
  # bogofilter (see the man page).  Turning this on may cause many
  # false positives and negatives if the filters aren't trained by you
  # frequently by reclassifying mail into the SPAM box or other
  # mailboxes.
